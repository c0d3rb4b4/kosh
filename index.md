Kosh has been conceived to provide API access to any XML-encoded lexical dataset. 
Its name Kosh derives from the Hindi word for dictionary or lexicon, कोश _koś_ or _kosh_, which in turn derives from Sanskrit कोश 
_kośa_ with the same meaning. 
Kosh’s origin is related to API development for [TEI-encoded Sanskrit dictionaries](https://cceh.github.io/c-salt_sanskrit_data/) at the University of Cologne, where the most important 
digital collection of Sanskrit dictionaries worldwide, the [Cologne Digital Sanskrit Dictionaries](https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/) is hosted.

## Features


* Kosh processes lexical data in XML format.
* Two APIs, GraphQL and REST, access the data stored in elasticsearch.
* Kosh can be deployed either via Docker or natively on Unix-like systems.

## How to run Kosh

You can configurate Kosh to create APIs for any XML-encoded lexical resource. Learn how to do it for your own resources in [deployment](/docs/deployment.md)
